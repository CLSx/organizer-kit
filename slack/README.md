# How to use CLSx Slack domain
*(very few recommendation to make everyone happier ;) )*

How CLSx Slack domain should be organised, to keep some sort of consistency across the different events and people involved? Here some recommendations to help. Recommendations, not rules ;)

## Goal of the Slack domain

Create a place where people can freely discuss about community management topics and organize CLSx events.

## Language

Because the global scope of the project, local languages are allowed in the appropriate country/language channels, while English should be used in the global channels.

## Global channels

*(**They are and they will always be**)*

* **clsx-organisers**: private channel for all the event organisers across the globe: useful to share widespread news, information, celebrate together

* **content-share**: do you have a link to share on community management topics? This is the appropriate channel to use, and a short description of the link to provide context is suggested. Ideally, everyone should be part of this channel

* **general**: we don’t have plans for this channel yet. Is the place where the worldwide CLSx community gathers

## Country channels

*(create based on the CLSx events organised)*

The idea is to have two channels per country and/or language:

* One public that, ideally, should collect all the CLSx event attendees for a specific countries and people of that country/language interested to talk about community management topics in their own language

* One private, for the organisers of CLSx events in the country. Here members can discuss about the organisation of their events, in the language suitable for all the members

To provide an example:

* **clsxitaly**: open to all the Italian-speaking people interested in community management topics. Is now composed by all the attendees of the different CLSx events happened in Italy and Italian is the language used

* **clsxitaly-org**: where the organisers of CLSx event in Italy are talking about the next events, their organisations etc, in Italian.

## To wrap-up: from a user point of view

If you’re a CLSx event attendee, you should join

* content-share

* clsx(your-country)

If you’re a CLSx event organiser, you should join

* content-share

* clsx(your-country)

* clsx(your-country)-org

* clsx-organisers
